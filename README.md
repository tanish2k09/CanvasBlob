# Intro
CanvasBlob is a javascript "component" that draws a Blob to an HTML canvas.
<br/>
This is a mirror copy of the blob used in my personal website at https://manku.dev/

# Customization potential

1. Shape, sector angle, number of anchor points, base radius, bump radius etc.
2. Energy aka thetaDelta
3. Regular canvas functions like fill colour and shadow
4. On-demand radius scale animation with any interpolator of choice
5. On-demand energy scale effect with any interpolator of choice
6. Event hooks for resize (throttleable) and scroll
